5. Got any comments about this assignment that you'd like to share?
> Why this assignment this hard. I mean if I only refer to the assignment instruction then it is impossible to finish. TODO segment is wide and didn't provide me any instruction where to implement the equations which were showing in the assignment instruction. But good to refer to others and see how they implent the equation. I mean if the TODO be a bit more specific then I think it would be a great experience. Though, the thing is fun! All the drawings looks pretty cool!
